# Smart Home Air Quality Monitor

## Problem Statement

A family in Milan, Europe, is concerned about indoor air quality during winter when wood is burned for heating. Poor ventilation can increase carbon monoxide (CO) and smoke levels, creating health risks. The objective is to design an IoT-based air quality monitoring system that continuously measures gas concentration, temperature, and humidity, provides visual and audible alerts based on air quality, and logs data locally so that the system continues to operate even when the internet is unavailable.

## Solution Approach

This project uses an **ESP32** as the main controller to monitor indoor environmental conditions. An **MQ-2 gas sensor** continuously measures smoke/CO concentration, while a **DHT22 (or DHT11)** measures temperature and humidity.

At startup, the MQ-2 sensor is calibrated by recording a baseline reading in clean air. During operation, the ESP32 compares the current gas sensor reading with the baseline to determine the air quality level.

The system classifies air quality into three levels:

* **SAFE** – Green RGB LED, buzzer OFF
* **MODERATE** – Yellow RGB LED with intermittent warning beep
* **DANGER** – Red RGB LED with continuous alarm

Every two seconds, the ESP32 records the timestamp, gas sensor value, temperature, humidity, and severity level in **CSV format** on the Serial Monitor for local data logging. Since all processing is performed on the ESP32, the system remains fully functional even without an internet connection.

| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| SAFE     | Gas level close to baseline      | Green   | OFF                      |
| MODERATE | Moderate increase above baseline | Yellow  | 1000 Hz warning beep     |
| DANGER   | High increase above baseline     | Red     | Continuous 2000 Hz alarm |
