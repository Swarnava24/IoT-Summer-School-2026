# Wi-Fi Temperature Monitor (ESP32)

## Project Overview

This project creates a web-based environmental monitoring system using an ESP32 and a DHT22 sensor. The ESP32 connects to a Wi-Fi network and hosts a web page that displays live temperature and humidity readings.

The web page automatically refreshes every 10 seconds and allows the user to control an LED remotely. The page also displays the device uptime.

## Hardware Required

* ESP32 Development Board
* DHT22 Sensor
* LED
* 220 Ω Resistor
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wires
* Wi-Fi Network

## Circuit Connections

### DHT22

| DHT22 Pin | ESP32 Pin |
| --------- | --------- |
| VCC       | 3.3V      |
| GND       | GND       |
| DATA      | GPIO 4    |

### LED

| LED Pin     | ESP32 Pin                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Anode (+)   | GPIO 2                     |
| Cathode (-) | GND through 220 Ω resistor |
